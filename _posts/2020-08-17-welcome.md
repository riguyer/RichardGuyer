Welcome to my new personal website and blog. I will use this space to share my thoughts regarding single cell genomics, computational analysis of
single cell data, developmental biology, stem cells, regenerative medicine, and other topics I find interesting. My hope is that scientific blogging
will become more common, as a way to disseminate ideas and data more rapidly than the traditional process of peer-reviewed publication. I do not
expect (or want) blogs such as this one to ever replace the traditional peer-reviewed papers, but I hope they can offer an outlet for ideas and 
discoveries not well suited to the time-honored process. Scientists, much like surgeons, accumulate "how-to" knowledge, tips, and tricks over the course 
of time, but there are not good ways to disseminate this valuable information except direct instruction. Methods papers are extremely
valuable resources, but they capture only a fraction of the most innovative and exciting new approaches. By making my thoughts publicly available in
this forum, I hope to help make such practical knowledge a bit more readily available.
