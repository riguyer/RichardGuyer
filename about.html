        <h2>About me</h2>
	<p>
	I am a general surgery resident at MGH, where I am working towards a career in academic pediatric surgery. I am currently also a postdoctoral 
	fellow in Allan Goldstein's laboratory, where I am using single cell RNA sequencing and traditional cell biology techniques to understand
	the transcriptional control of neurogenesis in the postnatal enteric nervous system. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	My long-term goal is to become an independently funded surgeon-scientist with a basic science laboraotry focused on understanding the normal 
	development and differentiation of neural crest cells. I believe this will help to understand how developmental perturbations cause childhood diseases, 
	such as neuroblastoma and Hirschsprung Disease. New information from this work may lead to novel therapies.
	</p>

	<p>
	I was born in Boston in 1984, and grew up in New Jersey and North Carolina. My undergraduate education was in Economics and Mathematics at Davidson
	College. I started my medical education as an MD/PhD student at the University of Virginia, and began my PhD work at UVA in Ian Macara's laboratory. 
	When I was about halfway through my PhD, Ian accepted a new position at Vanderbilt University and moved his laboratory. I transferred to Vanderbilt,
	from which I graduated in 2015 with a PhD in Cell and Developmental Biology and then in 2016 with my MD. Since 2016 I have been a surgical trainee at MGH.

	Outside of work, I enjoy running, watching hockey and soccer, cooking, working on my small but growing collection of California wines, and spending time 
	with my family. Unfortunately of late, I am a fan of the New York Football Giants, New Jersey Devils, and Tottenham Hotspur.
