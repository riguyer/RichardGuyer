      <p> I enjoy cooking and mixing up new cocktails. Unfortunately, I am prone to forget recipes if I don't write them down. I am compiling my favorite creations here, 
          for easy reference. I'm a believer in open source food as well as software!

      <h4>Paccheri with spicy Italian sausage</h4>
      <ul>
            <li> 1 lb spicy Italian sausage, casings removed </li>
            <li> 1 medium white onion, finely chopped </li>
            <li> 1 cup dry red wine </li>
            <li> 3 tblsp tomato paste </li>
            <li> Olive oil </li>
            <li> Grated Parmigiano </li>
            <li> Chopped fresh basil leaves </li>
            <li> Salt and pepper </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
            The key to this recipe is the quality of the sausage. I get mine at <a href=https://www.savenorsmarket.com/><b>Savenor's</b></a> in Cambridge. The
            wine will also make a difference, but not to the same degree. I usually use the Charles Shaw Red Blend from Trader Joe's, which will never be confused
            for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_Lafite_Rothschild#Price><b>Lafite,</b></a> but is a remarkably decent wine for such a ridiculously 
            low price.

            Heat a few dashes of olive oil in a large pan, and sautee the onions until they are becoming translucent. Then add the sausage to the pan, breaking it
            apart with a wooden spoon as it cooks. When the sausage is mostly cooked, add the wine and tomato paste and mix well. Let simmer for several minutes, until
            the wine is cooked down and absorbed. Meanwhile, cook the paccheri until it is al dente. Add a few dashes of pasta water to the sauce, stirring until
            it begins to develops a thick, shiny texture. Then add the pasta and cook for 1-2 more minutes on low heat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add
            a bit of grated Parmigiano cheese, to taste. Serve warm with chopped basil leaves and a few more dashes of Parmigiano on top.
